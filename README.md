👋 Hi, I’m @yaboigez
👀 I’m interested in building modern web applications, especially using React, TypeScript, and creative animations to enhance user experience.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced front-end development techniques using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and other cool libraries like Framer Motion and Swiper.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting front-end projects, particularly those focused on interactive and highly engaging user interfaces.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me on here.
⚡ Fun fact: I love adding subtle animations to my projects—making buttons come alive or pages transition smoothly is my kind of fun!
